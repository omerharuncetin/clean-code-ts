## Directory Structure and Descriptions 📂

This project is organized into several directories. Each practice has `Problem.ts` and `Solution.ts`. Each focusing on specific principles or concepts:

- **cohesion** 🧩
  - `mixed-domain`: Contains examples demonstrating how mixing different domains can affect cohesion.
  - `mixed-instance`: Showcases issues that arise when instances from different contexts are mixed, leading to reduced cohesion.

  - `interface`: Contains interfaces that are commonly used or shared across multiple components or modules.

- **single-responsibility-principle** 📏
  - `statement`: Demonstrates the importance of having each statement (or function) serve a single, clear purpose.
  - `method`: Contains examples where methods either adhere to or violate the Single Responsibility Principle.
  - `class`: Features classes designed with the Single Responsibility Principle in mind, as well as those that don't, to highlight the contrast.
